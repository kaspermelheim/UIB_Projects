Assignment 8 - INF222

8.3 TASK: Integer intrinsics

1. 
Java: Has signed and unsigned variables. Unsigned only takes postive numbers.
Pascal: The compiler checks if its signed/unsigned for you.
Python: Does not have default unsigned variables, but they can be computed in.

2. 
Java: The name of it is Int. It ranges from −2,147,483,648 all the way to 2,147,483,647
Pascal: The name of it is Integer. It ranges from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
Python: The name of it is Integer. The range of it is not fixed like in pascal and java, its the computers memory that decides how big of a number it can calculate.

3. Based on the mathematical problem 12 − 3 − 5 + −2 < −7 ∗ −11 % 8:

Python: Parentheses has the highest precedence. After that the exponentials follow. These are not in our example above. 
In the example above multiplication and modulus comes first. Then the addition and subtraction follows. Finally the comparison operator < is executed.

Java and Pascal: the precedence is implementation based. This means that there are no rules for the precendece in the standard, this is set by the code afterwards itself.

4.
Python: Found nothing.
Java: Two first properties are mentioned, the remaining are not.
Pascal: None of the properties are mentioned, but others ate.

8.4 Bonus TASK: Reals

1.
Java: Yes, Float and Double.
Python: Float
Pascal: Real-type from the standard, 

2.

Java: Float, range: 3.40282347 * 10^(38) to 1.40239846 * 10^(-45) and Double, range: 1.7976931348623157 x 10^(308), 4.9406564584124654 x 10^(-324)
Python: Float, range: Computers memory that decides how big of a number it can calculate.
Pascal: Real-type from the standard, range: no range.

3.
Yes, Java, Python and Pascal have reals that are IEEE 754 compliant.

8.5 TASK: Arrays

1. No

2. No

Java has object pointers, but thats about it.


8.6 TASK: Basic language versus standard libraries

1.
Java: Yes
Pascal: No
Python: Yes

2.
Standard library is not a single document but a collection of multiple files.

Python: Packages with tons of modules. When the compiler or interpretet is installed, the standard library follows. CPython is default, and there are multiple libraries.
Java: Packages with containing classes.
Both python and java have large standard libraries.

3.
It is specified on the last page of every documentation. 
Java: 789 pages (Java SE 15)
Python: Too many to count
Pascal: 92 pages.

4.
Java: Cant count.
Python: 2220
Pascal: Cant count.

8.7 TASK: Standards’ audience

1. Standards are made and written to avoid future problems and disagreement between developers and users regarding lagnuage specifications. It is filled to the brim, down to the
smallest details on how and what the language does, and when. Its a very specific set of paragraphs explaining the fundamental core elements of the language, meant for everyone that
wants to use the language, and understand it fully. The standard has a lot of theoretic words, and is not a easy read for most people.

2. An easier read of the documents would be having it on a webpage, cleanly organized with pages for each subject, and search bar for fast access.
