Description of concurrency classes/features in task 1:

In MatrixMult we have the multiply() method, that creates a thread for each iteration in the for loop, 
this happens because we want to run these concurrently. We also add it to the list of threads to keep track.

In waitForThread(), we use thread.join(), if this operation is interrupted we will throw an error. 
When .join() is called the thread goes into a waiting stage, and it will keep waiting until the thread terminates.
